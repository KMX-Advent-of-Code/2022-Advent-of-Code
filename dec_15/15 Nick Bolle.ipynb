    "I really like Marcos' solution: do my first idea, but efficiently by working on the level of intervals of locations that aren't allowed. In part 1 I used a dictionary to keep track of locations not allowed, but if we're looking for a location that *is* allowed, it's enough to get the intervals that each sensor prohibits and join them together (looking for a gap along the way).\n",
    "\n",
    "My solution ended up being too clever and would have been a pain if I'd gotten unlucky: you can reason that the allowed location is either on the edge of the 4,000,001 x 4,000,001 square (could check the edge separately), or is on the border of at least two of the sensors' not-allowed regions. So for each pair of sensors, solve the appropriate equations to find those intersection points. I ignored cases where borders overlap (giving a line of solutions) and it turns out that was enough to find the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "First idea\n",
    "- Just run the previous part on each of the 4000000 rows. Slow, but at least I don't have to use tons of memory storing the 4000000^2 locations.\n",
    "- But it's not running in reasonable time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second idea:\n",
    "- For each of the 4000000 locations, check its distance from the sensors. Print locations if they're outside of the disallowed range of every sensor.\n",
    "- Also would take forever: over 1 minute for n=10000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third idea:\n",
    "- The previous, but keeping a list of distances to each of the sensors. That way instead of recalculating the distances, we update the list of distances by +-1 depending on how our x-coord compares to those of the sensors.\n",
    "- Still too slow, takes 20 seconds to iterate through one row of the 4000000 locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth idea:\n",
    "- I can't be iterating through all the locations, but I can leverage that there is *one* free location so it must appear just outside the border of (at least) one of the no-go zones.\n",
    "- (If I find at least 2 open locations through this method, then it becomes possible that there's a free location that the method can't find. But that won't happen. And anyways, the unfound free locations would be adjacent to previously found locations (might need to iterate this a few times to find all of them)).\n",
    "- With this method I have to search 75,209,200 locations which is still a lot but much less than before. At 20 seconds per 4,000,000 this would take less than 7 minutes which is not great, but I'm probably on the right track. Oh! Only search positions that are inbounds, should help a lot. Leverage that the intersection of the sensor border is either totally inside the permissible region or intersects at one of the edges\n",
    "- Improving this a bit, we know the point is either on the edge of the permissible region *or* (not xor) it's on the border of (at least) two sensors' no-go-zones. Assuming the 2nd case, restrict the search to points that satisfy that condition. Those can be found by taking a pair of sensors and solving the equations that define their borders:\n",
    "$$|x-x_1| + |y-y_1| = d_1 + 1$$\n",
    "$$|x-x_2| + |y-y_2| = d_2 + 1$$\n",
    "- Solving for isolated cases is OK: just a bunch of cases with signs. I held off on solving cases where the lines containing the borders of two sensors overlap."
